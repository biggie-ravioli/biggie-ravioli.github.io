    <h2>Prayers from Above</h2>
    <!-- Your horror story content here -->
    <p>
      I live on the top floor of an apartment complex.  
      It’s not as cool as it sounds. Grocery runs suck and I’ve been late to work more than once because some toddler pressed every button on the panel. My boss was not happy with me.  
      But the worst part, the part that’s been bothering me lately, has nothing to do with traffic or bad neighbors.  
      It’s the sound.  
      Someone’s been praying upstairs.  
      Only… I’m on the top floor, so there is no "upstairs."
