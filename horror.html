      <h2>Prayers from Above</h2>
      <p>
        I live on the top floor of an apartment complex.  
        It’s not as cool as it sounds. Grocery runs suck and I’ve been late to work more than once because some toddler pressed every button on the panel. My boss was not happy with me.  
        But the worst part, the part that’s been bothering me lately, has nothing to do with traffic or bad neighbors.  
        It’s the sound.  
        Someone’s been praying upstairs.  
        Only… I’m on the top floor, so there is no "upstairs."
      </p>
      <p>
        It started a few weeks ago. Around 4AM, I’ll wake up to the faint sound of chanting, or singing. I can’t tell. It’s in a language I don’t recognize. Not Spanish, or Arabic, not anything I could even Google. The melody has this strange lilt, like a lullaby from another planet. Always just loud enough to pull me out of sleep and leave me staring at the ceiling, heart thumping, blankets up to my chin like I’m six years old again.  
        This ghost must LOVE Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I thought it was someone outside, maybe on the roof. But the sound isn’t muffled or distant, it’s right above me. Like the floorboards above are paper-thin.  
        I asked a couple of my neighbors if they ever hear anything weird at night. Most of them gave me polite, you okay, buddy? smiles and said no. One guy on the fifth floor told me he sleeps like the dead. Good for him, lucky bastard.  
        So, great. I’m the only one being haunted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a weird, stupid way, it made me feel better to think it might be a ghost. Ghosts are simple. Dead person with unfinished business, boom, done. But if it wasn’t a ghost, then what? A hole in reality? God? Maybe I should pick up a Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night, I decided I’d had enough. If I couldn’t explain it, maybe someone online could.  
        I downloaded one of those sleep apps that records if you talk in your sleep or whatever, and set it up before I went to bed. Left my phone on the nightstand, screen down. When I woke up, I found a file that was:  
        19 minutes and 37 seconds.  
        What the fuck?
      </p>
      <p>
        I sent the file to my laptop and scrubbed through it. The sound quality was garbage. A lot of shuffling, some snoring, and the usual creaking of the building. But buried in the middle of it. There it was. The prayer.  
        Muffled, faint, but there. Repeated, over, and over again.  
        I uploaded it to a few forums for audio nerds, religious scholars, paranormal investigators, asking if anyone could ID the language or prayer. Nothing useful, one dude suggested it might be someone playing Fetty Wap on a JBL speaker. Thanks dude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of desperation, I started messing with the audio. Boosted certain frequencies. Tried noise reduction. Still gibberish. But then I remembered something from my teenage YouTube years, those videos on YouTube in the 2000s that reversed Jay-Z and Beyonce songs to reveal their demonic laments to Satan...  
        I loaded up the file, aptly titled whatthefuckisthisshit.mp3, and reversed it.  
        I hit play.  
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, all I hear is white noise in reverse, which, as you might have concluded, sounds like white noise.  
        Then, slowly, the static thinned out.  
        And I heard it.  
        “Stonesss into breadddd. They turn. They turn.  
        Worship. Worship.  
        Fall in worship.  
        Rise Mastema.  
        Mastema.  
        Mastemaaaaaaa.  
        Bread intoooo stonessssss.”
      </p>
      <p>
        My stomach dropped. I didn’t even notice my hand pulling away from the mouse like I’d touched a hot stove.  
        My computer screen blinked to black. Sparks spat from my desktop like firecrackers. The power surged. My bedroom light exploded with a loud pop. The overhead bulb shattered, raining tiny glass daggers across the room. I stumbled back, heart clawing at my ribs.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I heard a deep crack above me.  
        I look up.  
        Concrete dust sprinkled from the ceiling. Just a little at first, like the building was settling.  
        Then more.  
        Chunks the size of fists. Then slabs. My ceiling started collapsing, crashing down in slow-motion terror, punching holes into the floor. The electrical wiring splintered out of the ceiling, like if you ripped a guy's forearm in half and all the veins and strings of skin were hanging on each side. My bed was smashed by the debris, so much for a good night’s sleep I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, there was no ceiling.  
        No beams. No attic. No roof. No sky.  
        Just… nothing.  
        An expanse of absolute black. No stars, no light, no depth. Like staring into the pupils of something blind and ancient.  
      </p>
      <p>
        A presence pressed down into the room. Heavy. Electric. My skin buzzed like I was being microwaved from the inside out.  
        Then it spoke.  
        “Thank. You.”
